# üõ°Ô∏è Contact Form Spam Protection - Quick Reference

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

Your contact form now has **6 layers of spam protection** to stop those fake bot submissions:

### 1. üçØ **Honeypot Field**

Hidden field that bots fill but humans don't see

- **Effectiveness:** Blocks 90% of basic bots

### 2. üö¶ **Rate Limiting**

Maximum 5 submissions per hour per IP address

- **Effectiveness:** Prevents spam floods

### 3. üîç **Content Validation**

Strict validation for all fields:

- Names: 2-80 letters only
- Subjects: 3-120 characters, no links
- Messages: 10-2000 characters, no HTML/links
- Spam keyword detection (viagra, casino, lottery, etc.)

### 4. üîë **Idempotency**

Prevents duplicate submissions and emails

- **Effectiveness:** No more duplicate emails

### 5. üìä **Comprehensive Logging**

Tracks IP, User-Agent, referrer for every request

- **Benefit:** See exactly what bots are trying

### 6. üìß **Email Security**

- No longer sends to customer (prevents spam loops)
- Uses `replyTo` for customer email (safe replies)
- Only sends to: avshi@, moshe@, info@

## üöÄ What To Do Now

### Step 1: Deploy the Changes

```bash
# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive spam protection to contact form"
git push origin master

# Apply database migration
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Step 2: Monitor for 1 Week

Check your logs to see spam attempts being blocked:

- Look for `[SPAM DETECTED]` - blocked attempts
- Look for `[RATE LIMIT]` - rate limited IPs
- Look for `[HONEYPOT]` - caught bots

### Step 3: If Spam Continues (Optional)

Implement Google reCAPTCHA v3 (see `docs/SPAM_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md`)

- Takes 1-2 hours to set up
- Provides 99%+ spam protection
- Free for most use cases

## üìä Expected Results

**Immediate (Day 1):**

- 90%+ reduction in spam submissions
- All bot traffic logged for analysis

**Week 1:**

- Remaining spam will be from sophisticated bots
- Logs will show which protection layers are working

**If Needed:**

- Add reCAPTCHA for near-perfect protection

## üîç Quick Monitoring

### View Spam Attempts (in production logs)

```bash
grep "SPAM DETECTED" logs
grep "RATE LIMIT" logs
grep "HONEYPOT" logs
```

### Check Database

```sql
-- Recent submissions
SELECT * FROM contact_messages
WHERE createdAt > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY createdAt DESC;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Adjust Rate Limit (if needed)

In `app/api/contact/route.ts`:

```typescript
if (entry.count >= 10) { // Change 5 to 10 for 10/hour
```

### Add Spam Keywords

In `app/api/contact/route.ts`:

```typescript
/\b(viagra|cialis|casino|YOUR_KEYWORD)\b/i;
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Legitimate users blocked?

1. Check logs for rejection reason
2. Adjust validation rules if too strict
3. See `docs/SPAM_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md` section on false positives

### Spam still getting through?

1. Implement reCAPTCHA v3 (recommended)
2. Review logs for new spam patterns
3. Consider Cloudflare Bot Protection
